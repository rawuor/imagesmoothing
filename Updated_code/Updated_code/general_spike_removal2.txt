GENERAL SPIKE REMOVAL CODE

This code removes spikes from an image (Fundamental, Ultraharmonic or both). It works in the following way:
1) Generates a fundamental and ultraharmonic image, in its 'spiked' form. 
2) Prompts the user to select the desired function, i.e; remove spikes in a Fundamental image, an Ultraharmonic image, 
   or both the Fundamental and Ultraharmonic image.
3) Prompts the user to select the unwanted region. This is the region surrounding the transducer, and is a product of
   the main bang. It contains no useful information and is therefore excluded in the subsequent computations
4) Prompts the user to select a spike. This returns the spike value and is useful in distinguishing the spike from 
   the background region and/or other artifacts that may be present in the image. 
5) Prompts the user to select the ROI, which is the region whose values are not altered during the spike removal process.
   This region usually contains information that is of interest to the user.
6) Prompts the user to select the background region. The background region selected forms the basis upon which the threshold
   is decided. The threshold in this case is used to distinguish the spike from a value that is not a spike. Any value
    crossing this threshold is assumed to be a spike, and is thus replaced by the average of the surrounding background
    region values.
7) Prompts the user to select a region in the background for the CTR computation, whose formula is as follows:
                 CTR = ROI - background
8) Produces an image with spikes removed and the unwanted middle region replaced with a matrix of zeros(black in color)
